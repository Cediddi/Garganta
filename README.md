### What is Garganta?
Garganta is a manga downloader written in "Glorious Python". It's name comes from popular manga/anime, Bleach.
In Bleach, garganta is a door between two planes (Earth and Hueco Mundo) and it looks pretty cool when it opens in mid air.

### Why I did this?
Because I wanted to read Gintama with turkish translations on my kindle touch. (Thanks to [KCC](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc)).
I did inspired from [HakuNeko](http://hakuneko.sf.net/) and I love to use it.

### How did I wrote this?
Mechanize and BeautifulSoup helped a lot. Other than that, python-wget and appdirs helped alot too, and awesome-slugify.

### What's next?
I want to add mangaturk, mangareader, mangafox too. But I'm a bit busy right now.
